# Image_Tampering_Detection
To verify authenticity of an image majorly, in the news industry, where fake news can spread misinformation to the masses.â€‹
Developed a Deep Learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Error Level analysis trained on datasets with original and tampered images.

 
Note- 
You can save model from jupyter file to create new .h5 file to load the model.
